# MyCraft

A single-player, browser-based Minecraft clone built with **Three.js + TypeScript + Vite**. All assets are generated programmatically at runtime -- zero external images, models, or sounds.

## Play

**Live demo:** Deployed automatically to GitHub Pages on push to `main`.

**Local dev:**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser. Click the canvas to lock the pointer and start playing.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| WASD / Arrows | Move |
| Mouse | Look around |
| Space | Jump |
| Shift | Sneak |
| Ctrl / Double-tap W | Sprint |
| Left click | Break block |
| Right click | Place block |
| 1-9 / Scroll wheel | Select hotbar slot |
| E | Open inventory |
| Escape | Pause menu |
| F3 | Debug overlay |

## Features

- **Procedural terrain** with biomes (plains, forest, desert, taiga, mountains, ocean, beach, tundra, jungle, swamp), caves, ore veins, trees, and structures (desert wells, cabins, dungeons)
- **Per-block lighting** -- sunlight column propagation, BFS flood-fill for sunlight spread and torch light, Minecraft-style face shading
- **Greedy meshing** with ambient occlusion for efficient chunk rendering
- **Web Worker** off-thread chunk meshing via a worker pool
- **First-person physics** with AABB collision (Y-X-Z swept resolution), gravity, and fall damage
- **Block interaction** -- hold-to-break mining with crack overlay, tool speed bonuses, and DDA raycasting
- **Block drops** -- broken blocks spawn 3D item entities that bob, spin, and are picked up on proximity
- **Tool durability** -- tools wear down with use and break when depleted; durability bars in hotbar/inventory
- **Inventory system** -- 36-slot inventory with drag-and-drop
- **Food system** -- eat raw/cooked food to restore hunger; passive health regen when well-fed; starvation damage
- **Crafting** -- 2x2 (inventory) and 3x3 (crafting table) grids with 26 recipes
- **Furnace smelting** -- smelt ores into ingots and cook raw food; real-time fuel/progress system
- **Combat** -- melee attack mobs with swords (damage scales by tier); mobs drop items on death
- **Procedural sound** -- all audio generated at runtime via Web Audio API oscillators and noise buffers
- **HUD** -- health hearts, hunger drumsticks, armor shields, experience bar
- **Day/night cycle** -- 20-minute full cycle with dynamic sky dome, sun/moon, stars, and fog
- **Mobs** -- passive (cow, pig, chicken) and hostile (zombie, skeleton) entities via bitECS with state-machine AI
- **World persistence** -- IndexedDB save/load with RLE chunk compression and auto-save
- **GitHub Pages deployment** -- zero-cost static hosting via GitHub Actions

## Key Algorithms

- **Terrain:** Multi-octave 2D simplex noise heightmap + 3D noise cheese/spaghetti caves
- **Lighting:** Column sunlight scan + BFS flood-fill (sunlight + block light), packed nibble storage
- **Meshing:** Greedy meshing (Mikola Lysenko / 0fps algorithm) with per-vertex AO + light
- **Collision:** Swept AABB resolved per-axis (Y, X, Z)
- **Raycast:** DDA voxel traversal (Amanatides & Woo)
- **Mob AI:** State machine (IDLE / WANDER / CHASE / ATTACK / FLEE)
- **Chunk compression:** Run-length encoding (~4:1 ratio on typical terrain)

## Zero-Cost Asset Strategy

All visual assets are generated at runtime:
- **Block textures** -- Canvas2D pixel art drawn programmatically (16x16 tiles)
- **Sun/Moon** -- Radial gradient on canvas
- **Mob meshes** -- Colored box geometries (no model files)
- **UI** -- Pure HTML/CSS generated from TypeScript
- **Sky** -- Custom GLSL gradient shader
- **Sound** -- Web Audio API oscillators and noise buffers (no audio files)

## Testing

### Run locally

```bash
npm install        # Install dependencies (first time only)
npm run dev        # Start Vite dev server with HMR
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser. Click the canvas to lock the pointer and begin playing.

### Troubleshooting

**Items missing from hotbar / can't place blocks:**
The game saves to IndexedDB. If you have a stale save from an older version, clear it:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** > **Storage** > **IndexedDB**
3. Delete the `mycraft` database
4. Refresh the page -- you'll get a fresh world with starter items

**Right-click doesn't place blocks:**
- Click the canvas first to lock the pointer (you'll see the cursor disappear)
- Your selected hotbar slot must contain a placeable block (not a tool or empty)
- The block count decreases by 1 each time you place

**Screen appears frozen:**
- Check the browser console (F12 > Console) for errors
- Try a hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

### Type check & build

```bash
npm run build      # TypeScript check + Vite production build -> dist/
npm run dev        # Vite dev server with HMR
```

Deployment to GitHub Pages is automatic via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` on push to `main`.

- [x] Structure generation -- desert wells, wooden cabins with furnishing, underground cobblestone dungeons
- [x] Jungle & swamp biomes -- tall jungle trees, jungle wood/leaves blocks, swamp vegetation, Whittaker-diagram classification

### Mid-term

- [ ] **Infinite world** -- stream chunks in/out based on player position (currently pre-generated radius)

- [ ] **More biomes** -- mushroom island, mesa, savanna
- [ ] **Structure generation** -- villages, mineshafts (basic desert wells, cabins, and dungeons done)
- [ ] **Multiplayer** -- WebSocket or WebRTC peer-to-peer for LAN-style co-op

### Long-term

- [ ] **Enchanting & anvil** -- enchantment table UI, XP cost system
- [ ] **Nether / End dimensions** -- portal mechanics, new terrain generators
- [ ] **Modding API** -- plugin system for custom blocks, items, recipes, and world generators
- [ ] **Mobile support** -- touch controls with virtual joystick and buttons
- [ ] **Procedural audio engine** -- full soundtrack and ambient sounds from oscillators
